"""
SRIBEESonline - Session Location API (Module 2.3)

The platform is hyper-local: a customer's active delivery location dictates the
branch whose catalog, prices, stock and discounts they see. This router lets the
client set that location from a saved address; the resolved branch is stored in
the customer's Redis session so every subsequent GET /products scopes to it.

  POST /session/set-location  — resolve an address → branch, save to session
  GET  /session/location      — read the current session location/branch

Prefix "/session" is applied by app/api/v1/router.py.
